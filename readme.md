# Blog

This is a lightweight static blog written in laravel. You can see it in action [here](http://blog.maximeleboeuf.com).

## How to use

There is no database. Posts go in the `app/views/posts` directory and must have an `.html` extension.

The posts listing must be manually updated in `app/views/index.blade.php`. This might be improved in a future version to be dynamically generated.
